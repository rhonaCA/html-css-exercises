# HTML & CSS Extra Challenges

## Before You Continue
This activity relies on a basic understanding of git branching. A good place to learn some basics is [this helpful guide](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/how-to-use-git-branches/). 

A common "gotcha" that new learners make is forgetting to **add** and **commit** before switching branches, if you forget to do this your changes will move from the old branch to the new branch, which is **NOT** what you want.

## How to start
You'll notice that there are no files or challenges at the moment. Each one of these challenges are separated by a branch in git and will be released periodically, you are currently in the master branch and can switch to the first challenge by running the command `git checkout -b first-branch` in your terminal inside this git repository.

Once you have switched branches, you need to run the command `git pull origin first-branch`, what we are doing is downloading everything from the 'first-branch' branch on the github repository, we've named the github branch and your local branch the same name to reduce some confusion. After you've done that, you'll be able to see a new markdown file with the next instructions.

Remember that if you forget what to do after switching branches, you can run the command `git checkout master` to come back to this branch.
