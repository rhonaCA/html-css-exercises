# HTML & CSS Extra Challenges

## What now?
Great job switching branches and pulling down from github, I knew you had it in you. We've written a couple of straight-forward challenges to practice your html by mimicking something existing. Now is also a good time to practice some more git, after you've finished each challenge remember to git add and commit after you've saved your work. 

## What next?
After you have completed both challenges and added/committed your work, we are going to want to switch branches again. All of our work is going to be contained to the right branch, but what we need to do first is switch back to master and then checkout a new branch called 02-css-fundamentals, the reason why we switch to master first is because when we create a new branch it is a copy of the branch we are currently on and we don't want anything in our new branch except the readme until after we pull down from github. Remember that you only want to switch branches when it is safe to do so, you can test if it is safe by running the command `git status` and if the last of your output says 'working tree clean' then you are safe to switch branches by running the command `git checkout -b 02-css-fundamentals`. Once you've switched branches you'll need to pull down from github to download all the files into the new branch.
